# vt125-rom
ROM contents of DEC VT100 and VT125 terminals
These ROMs I read from the terminal I got from the soon to be demolished factory. The VT100 part should be correct as it fits other VT100 ROM dumps found online. As I dumped an additional VT100 character generator ROM that contains Russian uppercase letters.

VT125 ROM dumps seems to be first ones on the web and I hope that these are correct.

Use on your own risk for your own fun. :)

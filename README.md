# vt125-rom
ROM contents of DEC VT100 and VT125 terminals
These ROMs I read from the terminal I got from the soon to be demolished factory. The VT100 part should be correct as it fits other VT100 ROM dumps found online. VT125 ROM dumps seems to be first ones on the web and I hope that these are correct.
Use on your own risk for your own fun. :)
